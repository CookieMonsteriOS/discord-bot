# Python Discord Bot

This Python script creates a simple Discord bot using the `discord.py` library. The bot has two basic commands: `!hello` and `!info`.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- discord.py (`pip install discord.py`)

## Getting Started

1. Create a new Discord application and obtain your bot token from the Discord Developer Portal.
2. Replace `'your_bot_token_here'` in the script with your actual bot token.
3. Customize the bot by adding more commands or modifying existing ones according to your requirements.
4. Run the script using `python bot.py` to start the bot.

## Bot Commands

### `!hello`

- Greets the user with "Hello!" when invoked.

### `!info`

- Displays information about the bot in an embedded message.
- Includes details such as the bot creator, library used (discord.py), and a footer with a message.

## Notes

- Ensure that your bot has been invited to your Discord server using the generated invite link.
- You can customize the bot further by adding event handlers, implementing additional commands, or integrating with external APIs.
